    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A trio of sunflower, hemp and flax seeds team up in this satisfying hot oatmeal. Seeds provide omega-3 fats
        which are essential to your health and lignans which reduce cholesterol and provide extra protection against cancer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>/4 cup steel cut oats</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened soy, hemp or almond milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons raisins</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh or frozen blueberries or mixed berries</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon raw sunflower seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hemp seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground flax seed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine the oats, non-dairy milk and raisins. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce heat and simmer
            for 12-15 minutes, stirring gently to prevent sticking, until oats are tender and liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Stir in blueberries and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in seeds and cinnamon.</li>
